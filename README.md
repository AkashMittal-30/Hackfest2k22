<b>Our Idea : </b>
<p>We create a platform where citizens would be able toupload the medicine's name they don't need anymore and then those medicines would be collected and re-distributed among needy people.Our application aims to reduce the medical wastage happening all over India by creating a simpler andeasier way of communication between the citizens and the NGO's. This will also cut-off the demands of medicines and hence the cost.</p>

<i>Some Background Knowledge: </i>
<i> India's concern over medicine is a huge issue. India generated 56,898 tonnes of Covid-19 bio-medical waste between June 2020 and June 2021.Nowadays, medicines are getting costlier and noteveryone can afford them. So instead of dumping the remaining medicines, it can be re-distributed(If not expired) to the people who need those Medicines. Such tasks are carried out by several NGO's but many citizens are still not aware of these and NGO's also lack a systematic way of collecting and redistributing medicines. </i>

<h1> Our Current Back-End Progress :</h1>
On the Backend part, we have created the database schema of the user and the medicine , also we have created various routes for login , registration , and donor form filling,also we had setup nodemailer in the website to use as a mailing system these routes will now be linked to the frontend of the website and hence the website will work integratively.
