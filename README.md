<b>Our Idea : </b>
<p>We create a platform where citizens would be able toupload the medicine's name they don't needanymore and then those medicines would becollected and re-distributed among needy people.Our application aims to reduce the medical wastagehappening all over India by creating a simpler andeasier way of communication between the citizensand the NGO's. This will also cut-off the demands ofmedicines and hence the cost.</p>

<i>Some Background Knowledge: </i>
<i> India's concern over medicine is a huge issue. Indiagenerated 56,898 tonnes of Covid-19 bio-medicalwaste between June 2020 and June 2021.Nowadays, medicines are getting costlier and noteveryone can afford them. So instead of dumpingthe remaining medicines, it can be re-distributed(Ifnot expired) to the people who need thoseMedicines. Such tasks are carried out by severalNGO's but many citizens are still not aware of theseand NGO's also lack a systematic way of collectingand redistributing medicines. </i>
